joemail

Author: mastronardif@gmail.com

Description: joemail is a version 101 program, it does everything through
email.  Email is the interface.  Version 101 has the following capabilities:
1. You can update your google calander.
2. You can surf the web
3. You can sort freecycle@yahoogroups.com.

Oh an most importantly you can do all this w/ your iTouch/iPhone in a disconnected fashion.  
You must have a McDonalds, Starbucks, or public Wi-Fi to synch up.  An imagination always helps.
